## Primitive Tensor Function

Primitive Tensor Function a tensor function that corresponds to a single "unit" of computational operation.


## Tensor Program Abstraction


- **Multi-dimensional buffers**: that holds the input, output, and intermediate results.

- **Loop nests**: that drive compute iterations.

- **Computations**: statement.


Primitive tensor function refers to the single unit of computation in model execution. 

- One important MLC process is to transform implementation of primitive tensor functions

Tensor program is an effective abstraction to represent primitive tensor functions.

- Key elements include: multi-dimensional buffer, loop nests, computation statement.

- Program-based transformations can be used to optimize tensor programs.

- Extra structure can help to provide more information to the transformations.
